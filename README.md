# liri-node-app
An application meant to retrieve information on touring bands, individual songs, and movies via node in the terminal.

## Technology
This application uses the following technologies via javascript:

-fs

-dotenv

-moment

-node-spotify-api

-inquirer

-axios

## Challenges
Prior to finding the Oject.keys() and Object.values() functions I was having a large amount of difficult figuring out how to parse the api reponses.  The Object functions made things vastly easier.
